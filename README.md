# ATmega32_Autonomou_car_system
I've used ATmega 32 as the microcontroller to accomplish AUTONOMOUS CAR ROBOT. Which function is to detect any obstacle, avoid its road and move away using.
Autonomous Car Robot

Designed and developed an autonomous car robot using AVR Atmega32 microcontroller and C programming language

Used DC motors for motion control, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, a servo motor for ultrasonic sensor motion's control, and an LCD for displaying system information

Implemented a control system to detect obstacles, avoid them, and move away using the ultrasonic sensor and servo motor

Used timers to control the servo motor motion through Timer 1 PWM mode15 and to count the pulses taken to measure obstacle distance through Timer 0 normal mode

Implemented an external interrupt 0 to detect the ultrasonic sensor's input pulse signal for obstacle detection

Used GPIO to control input/output directions of the microcontroller

Conducted testing and debugging to ensure proper functionality of the system.
